Hi! I am Mariane, born and raised in the city of Rio Grande at south of Brazil, where I took my technical education in Software Development, and earned my graduation degree in Computer Engineering. At the end of college, I moved to the state of SÃ£o Paulo to get my master's degree in Computational Mechanics Engineering. For the past years, still living in SÃ£o Paulo, I've worked as developer and solution architect at Aeronautical Industry, providing and maintaining Digital Factory solutions for manufacturing processes.

<p>
Last year, I've quit my job. The plan was to move with my husband to Canada as soon as our Confirmation for Permanent Residence was ready. The confirmation came; as well as the COVID-19 pandemic to put off our plan a little bit longer. Not a problem: while waiting to move, I am taking time to renew my skills over things that I did not have the opportunity to work with in my last position.

Anyway, glad you are here!

### ðŸ˜„ Hobbies

<div align="justify">
<p>
I love to learn languages. To me, languages represent a bit of the population's culture and thus, they are an important part to empathize and to coexist respectfully.
I've started early in life with English, due to some <strike>old but gold</strike> Long Plays of American and British bands that my father used to have at home. By the time, they came with printed lyrics; that and a mini-dictionary "Portuguese-to-English" was all that I needed to start translating songs and to learn!
Many years later, I have started with Duolingo. Waaay easier than my old dictionaries, it got me learning Spanish, German, and now French. Do I know how to use all theses languages fluently? Definitely not! My intention and efforts are indeed directed to develop French as third language, but all the others are just to get to the main point here: always keep on learning!
</p>
<p>
Another old hobby is music. Since I was very young, I could freely (but carefully!) play with my dad's LPs and tapes. It was such a fun to spent time listening to his records! Music is good for the mind, and it is even better for the soul: even in distance, my dad and I still share good times discussing bands and songs!
Now, after several years only as audience, I've been learning musical foundations and how to play piano. One step at the time, one day I will be hopefully playing nicely enough to honor some of the great artists who inspired me during all these years.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the latest of my hobbies is... to read. The idea is to always have a book on my bed side and to read a bit e-v-e-r-y-d-a-y. Just a couple of rules:

1) it can be about pretty much any subject, in any of the languages I can read, but never related to work. Although very welcome, work related readings are for work/study hours, not for bedtime!

2) it must include Brazilian literature books. I have never enjoyed literature classes while in High School, but let's be honest, it can be hard to follow up books written more than 100 years ago, with words that not even Google knows the meaning! That demands maturity beyond adolescence's capabilities! Gladly, now I understand the importance of it and it feels great to read the great writers that, despite the different times experienced in their lives, still have a lot to offer for the days that follows!
